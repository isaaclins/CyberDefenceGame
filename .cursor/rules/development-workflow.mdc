# Development Workflow

This project follows a strict development and testing procedure. You are required to adhere to it for every change you make.

### Roadmap
Your primary guide for tasks is the [ROADMAP.md](mdc:ROADMAP.md). Implement the features as outlined in the roadmap.

### Test-After-Implement Cycle
It is crucial to ensure the game remains in a working state at all times.

1.  After implementing a feature or a sub-task from the roadmap (e.g., checking off an item), run the game to test your changes.
2.  To run the game, execute the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    ./runGame.sh
    ```
3.  **Analyze the output:**
    - If the terminal output includes `Game closed.`, the test is considered successful.
    - Any other output, especially stack traces or error messages, indicates a failure.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    - **You are required to attempt to fix any errors you encounter.**
    - Analyze the error message, review your recent changes, and apply a fix.
    - Repeat the test cycle until the game runs successfully.
